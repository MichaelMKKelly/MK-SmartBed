# MK-SmartBed
This Project was mostly a learning exercise for myself to learn about creating a custom sensor control using an esp32.
I decided write this up in case this helps or inspires someone else to do the same or a simalar project.

## Project Goal

Use multiple FSR Sensors to detect presence in a bed
Add a tempreture sensor to the bed
Have this report into home Assistant
OR this sensor with a prexisting mmWave Sensor to help ensure accurate room presence detection
